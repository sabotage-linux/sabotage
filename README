This is sabotage, an experimental distribution based on musl libc and busybox.
Currently sabotage supports i386 and x86_64, and ARM.

Requirements:
- ~4G free disk space
- root access
- usual GCC 4 toolchain
- git
- a bootloader of your choice (extlinux is favored)
- lots of time and a fair bit of Linux knowledge

This system has been built on up-to-date Debian, Ubuntu, Suse, Gentoo, Exherbo and Arch systems.

You can bootstrap your own build from the scripts at 

               https://github.com/rofl0r/sabotage

or use a ready-to-boot disk image either for netinstall or with sets
included (put it on an USB stick, burning a CD will not work), to be
found at:

           http://xmw.de/mirror/sabotage/ (very much outdated)

You also can netboot the install kernel directly (use pxelinux from
somewhere).

READ THE COOKBOOK FIRST.

Build instructions:  Caveat emptor, this is all pre-alpha!
DO NOT RUN SCRIPTS YOU HAVE NOT READ.

% cp KEEP/config.stage0 config
% vi config
  $K  directory with patches
  $S  where sources are compiled (stage0: ~700MB, stage1: ~2.1GB)
  $R  root file system

% . ./config       # required!

% ./build-stage 0  # build toolchain (~2min on an AMD FX 8core, 75min on ARM Cortex A8 800Mhz)
% ./enter-chroot   # enter $R chrooted, needs root password
% cd /src
% vi config        # set your MAKE_THREADS, etc
% . config
% butch install stage1
% butch install xorg

etc.. you can look around in /src/pkg to see which additional useful
packages you can find... install them using butch, i.e.
% butch install nano
% butch install gdb

copy $R to a ext4 file-system
# extlinux -i $R/boot

# butch install pkg           # additional stuff
# butch install  xorg          # build X.org

Run "butch" and look at the usage information it outputs for further options.
butch uses build templates, please take a look at KEEP/butch_template_configure_cached.txt
to see how it works.

The default root password is "sabotage".


NOTE TO CONTRIBUTORS
if you want to add packages, start from KEEP/package.template .
please do not use HTTPS or FTP mirrors.
HTTPS is unsupported by busybox wget, and FTP is a broken protocol from the 70ies
which needs a second data connection (i.e. open port on the client).
this prevents FTP from working when behind a NAT router or socks proxy.
Downloads from git or other source repositories is an absolute no-go.

since sabotage ships all tarballs when an ISO or HD image is distributed (to
fulfill the GPL), space considerations are a top issue.
so if available, ALWAYS USE a TAR.XZ (preferred) or TAR.BZ2 download URL.
in the former case, xz has to be added to the [deps] section.
