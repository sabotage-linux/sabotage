#want to leave the sabotage-linux/sabotage repository intact.
#changes for building binary packages for Quirky Linux, where they
#conflict with main repo, are kept separate. This includes alternative
#recipes named with "qky-" prefix, for example "pkg/qky-e2fsprogs".

#as quirky is building libblkid and libuuid in util-linux (actually qky-util-linux),
#need to modify pkg/libuuid and pkg/libblkid, but have to do this at build-time...
